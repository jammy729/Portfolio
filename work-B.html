                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <h4>Create kinetic typography with audio and I chose part of a speech from the film Rocky Balboa (2006).
                    I chose this audio because it was emotional, fast and inspirational. To do this project, it required
                    Adobe software After Effects and use of storyboard.
                </h4>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <h4>Unexpected strategy but I listened to the audio more than 10 times and after that, I was able to
                    visualize certain part of the scenes because of the changes in tones and images created in my mind
                    of how I want the texts to appear. On my storyboard, I did a quick sketch of what I visualized
                </h4>
                <img src="src/workB/storyboard.png" alt="cover" class="responsive-image-B">

                <h4>
                    After finishing with the rough sketches on the storyboard, I started to put words on the After
                    Effects software and proceed. I made a lot of adjustments on the layout/transition and how I want to
                    put the words. This work was my first time working with After Effects so initially I struggled but I
                    found myself learning a lot through the project and it seemed much easier as I started to feel more
                    comfortable.
                </h4>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <h4>The first challenge I faced was not understanding what kinetic typography was. Kinetic typography
                    should be focused on the movement of the typography not illustrations but I had a lot of
                    illustrations that replaces words as it was my initial visualization for me when I heard the audio.
                    I overcome that challenge by replacing illustrations with words that resemble similar connotations.

                <img src="src/workB/typography-a.png" alt="cover" class="responsive-image-B">

                <h4>
                    Since speeches were motivational, a lot of images were created in my head while listening. I wanted
                    to show that in the project but struggled to do so. I decided that taking verbs such as “fast”,
                    “hard”, “forward” and using that as my animations solve the problem.
