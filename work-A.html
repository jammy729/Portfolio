                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <h4>Create fictional topic and create magazine and digital spreads. It introduced us to grid in the
                    composition, setting type and involved colours. This was a group project and my contribution was to
                    make the magazine and digital spreads. The artifact below shows the initial stage of the layout for
                    both magazine and digital.
                </h4>
                <img src="src/workA/layout.png" alt="cover" class="responsive-image">
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <h4>Brainstorming ideas of which fictional topic to choose from and in the end, the group chose “Spring
                    Garden”
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Next step was to create layout sketches and I decided to go with a minimalistic look. The layout
                    sketches were done on a piece of paper and was later transferred to Adobe InDesign to put the work
                    together.
                </h4>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <h4>Given fixed dummy text limited my initial creativity that I had in my mind. This challenged me to
                    make changes in picture size, column grid, and insert texts on the cover page. After several
                    adjustments, I was able to fit all the texts and images.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Choosing a colour scheme for the titles on the cover page and images were difficult. I decided to
                    extract colours from the flower and change them slightly so it resembles, yet have contrast so it
                    can be legible. For the images in the magazine spread, I thought of colours that reminded me of the
                    “theme” and my group came with “yellow, green, and red so I decided to find images that include
                    these colours mainly.
